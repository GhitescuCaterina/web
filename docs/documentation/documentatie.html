                        The "vroomData (Auto Park Smart Explorer)" project caters to two primary user classes: administrators and analysts.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Administrators are granted extensive privileges within the platform. They have the authority to manage the overall system, including user accounts and data access. Administrators can create, edit, and delete user accounts, ensuring the smooth functioning of the platform. They also have the ability to invite other users to access the platform and can oversee a list of users with access permissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Analysts, on the other hand, are the users invited by administrators to utilize the platform for data analysis. While they cannot perform administrative tasks like creating or deleting accounts, analysts have the capability to explore and manipulate data within the confines of their access permissions. They can view and modify data related to the auto park statistics, enabling them to derive insights and make informed decisions.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        Both administrators and analysts have the option to create personal accounts, providing them with access to the platform's functionalities. They can log in to their accounts securely and delete them if necessary.

                        When a user creates an account, the application will send an email to the email address that the user provided, in order to verify that the email address is valid. The user will have to click on a link in the email in order to verify the email address and activate the account. The user will not be able to log in to the application until the email address is verified.<sup><a href="#footnote">[*]</a></sup>

                        The data kept by the application regarding the users' profiles is not shared with any third party. The data is only used by the application and the users that have access to the profiles.

                        Regarding the security of the application, the passwords of the users are stored in the database in an encrypted form, using an algorithm we will choose later. The passwords are not stored in plain text.

                [*] These implementations are related to some extra features that we think would be useful for the purpose of the application. We hope that we will have enough time to try to implement them in the future.
